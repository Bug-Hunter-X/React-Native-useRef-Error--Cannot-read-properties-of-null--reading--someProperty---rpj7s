This error occurs when using the `useRef` hook in React Native to access a component's instance, but the component hasn't mounted yet.  Attempting to access `current` on the ref before the component is mounted returns `null`, which can cause unexpected behavior or crashes if not handled appropriately.

```javascript
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const myRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // This will cause an error if the component hasn't mounted yet
    console.log(myRef.current.someProperty); 
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text ref={myRef}>Hello</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent; 
```
